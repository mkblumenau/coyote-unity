			The AI for the player is also included here.
		PlayerUIScript
			Attached to the "Player UI" game object, which has all the buttons for the UI under it
			Controls updating the display for the tentative bid input system, as well as letting the player do actions
			These actions are functions in the script; you have to use the editor to tell the buttons to do them
		UpdatePlayerTotalText
			This script updates the text that tells the player how many eyes they have and what the total visible to them is.
		GameManagerScript
			This is the script that runs the gameplay.
			That includes tracking any variables not attached to a player (such as the middle card and the current bid).
			It also resets for each round (including dealing out the cards) and tracks whose turn it is.
		GameLogManager
			This script updates the game log.
		MenuControlScript
			This script is used both in the game and on the main menu.
			Its actions:
				Showing and hiding menus, paying attention to if any menus are already open
				Pausing and unpausing the game
				Changing scenes
		UpdateAllPlayerInfo

	Deprecated scripts
		DisplayUIManagerScript
			This script was used for running the previous text-based UI.
			The game log functions it had have been moved to GameLogManager.

				Turn on the "Display UI Manager" script under Game log manager
				Turn off the "Update All Players Info" script on Player info displays (under Canvas)
				Show "Old UI elements"
