Things I need (old outline, ignore this):
	A script for a player (Either human or computer)
		Variables
			Card they're holding
			If they're a human
			Is it their turn
		Methods
	A script just for human player actions
	A script for the UI
	A game manager script
		Tracks what turn it is
		Shuffles the cards, deals them out
		Tracks bid
		Determines who wins challenge
		Variables
			Cards list
		
		
In the game already:
	The game is now technically fully functional.
	The AI seems fine. It seems a little quick to challenge, but that's not my biggest problem.
	The UI works, although graphically it's pretty basic.
	
Issues:
	When playing on 5 players, the middle card is above the menu.
	
Want to add:
	Game log- when outputting the results of a challenge, include which player had which card
	Game log- increase size of container every time a line is added, so the player can still see everything
	Maybe revamp the game so the cards are gameObjects?
	In the player UI, make it so that the unusable buttons hide
		I don't know if this is possible; currently they're just disabled
	In the player info displays, truncate the player names
		Not that much of an issue, since the game sets all those names itself
		
Progress:
	2023-07-18
		Made it so playersList is now a function returning the children of the players container, not a new list copied from that
		Changed the turn counter to hold a playerScript instead of being based on integer IDs
		Made the graphics scale a little better
		Fixed a bug where each time the cards total was counted, a new card was removed from the deck for ?
		Made it so if there's a ? card, the bonus card drawn from it shows in the game log
		
		Currently in the scripting, if you guess the exact total, you'll win a challenge.
			To change this, edit FinishResolvingChallenge() in GameManagerScript and challenge() in GameLogManager.
		If you add new values to the deck:
			In PlayerScript, make sure you change AILowBound and AIHighBound.
			If you add something below -10, edit maxSeenSoFar in totalKnownToPlayer() in PlayerScript to be 1 less than the new lowest card.
			In GameManagerScript, make sure that defaultFirstBid is 1 less than the lowest possible total of cards on 3 players.
			If the new values are the same as the current values for maxZeroValue and questionValue in GameManagerScript, change them to new numbers that aren't in the deck.
			Add a sprite for the new card on Player info displays.
		Places where the code would have to change if cards became GameObjects:
			Create a new class "PlayingCard" with an int value, as well as checkboxes for if it's Max 0 or ?
				It would also have a sprite value
			Create a new object that all the prefab cards are under
			Make a script to copy all the cards from it into a deck object, then shuffle
			Create zones for the deck and middle card
			Make a function to deal them out to each PlayerScript
			PlayerScript
				Instead of cardHeld, have a function to get the first child of the player
					That or give each player a hand zone
				Edit totalKnownToPlayer, totalKnownToPlayerWithSpecials
			GameManagerScript
				Edit cardTranslated, cardsTotal, setUpRound
				Replace makeDeck, drawRandomCard

		Reworked the menu system: in-game, all menus are now submenus of one new main menu
		Reworked the Quit menu
			Previously it asked if you wanted to quit; this gave a yes-or-no choice where yes just returned to the main menu
			It now offers a detailed choice between returning to the main menu, exiting the game entirely, or returning to the game
		Added a menu for exporting the game log to a file
		Added the number of eyes that the player has to the display showing the total visible to the player
			It was already visible in the list of players, but this makes it a little easier to see
		Cleaned up the code by deleting a bunch of commented-out stuff
			I backed the old versions of the scripts to a different folder so I can still look back on them
		Added TextFileOutputScript and UpdatePlayerTotalText
		Made it so the game log includes peeks
		Added a pause after challenges are resolved, giving the player the opportunity to see all the cards
		Fixed some issues
	2023-06-11
		Tweaked the AI
		Built for the first time (why is the UI the same size as it is in the editor but the game is still fullscreen)
	2023-06-10
		Replaced the old text-based UI with a more visually interesting UI
		Added card sprites to the game
		Created a bunch of scripts
			UpdateAllPlayerInfo
			PlayerInfoDisplayScript
			GameLogManager
			NumPlayersMenuScript
			CreateComputerPlayersScript
		Deprecated DisplayUIManagerScript
		Allowed the player to customize the number of players
	2023-06-09
		Added a working scrollbar and close button to the Rules menu
		Added the Rules and Quit menus and a pause button to the game
		Added MenuControlScript (replacing the short-lived MainMenuScript)
		Made the game manager automatically detect players from GameObjects
	2023-06-08
		Added a Rules menu to the main menu screen (it's incomplete)
	2023-06-07
		Got the game to the point of being playable
		Implemented player UI and bare-bones AI
		Added PlayerUIScript
		Added DisplayUIManagerScript (which at first was just functionality moved from GameManagerScript)
		Added an intro screen
	2023-06-06
		Started project
		Created PlayerScript, GameManagerScript
		Got the game to the point that you could deal cards out to the players and the middle, and display everything onscreen as text
			(There was no next-turn display yet, as well as no UI for actually taking turns)
		I may have implemented some of the functions for the actions on turns
